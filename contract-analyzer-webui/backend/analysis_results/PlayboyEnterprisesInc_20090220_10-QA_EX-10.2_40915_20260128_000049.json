      "content": "The extracted text of the 'IP Ownership Assignment' clause is:\n\n(ii) Supplier will not sell, ship or otherwise dispose of any such merchandise except upon the order of Purchaser or Playboy; \n\n(iv) Supplier will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser andPlayboy and the distributors and dealers and the officers and employees of each of the foregoing against all liability whatsoever which may be incurred by them or any of them as a result of any alleged defects in material or workmanship in the merchandise covered by this Contract.\n\nHowever, it appears that these clauses do not explicitly state an 'IP Ownership Assignment'.",
      "summary": "This contract clause does not explicitly state an \"IP Ownership Assignment\" but rather contains provisions related to the supplier's obligations regarding the sale and disposal of merchandise (clause ii) and indemnification for defects in material or workmanship (clause iv). These clauses suggest that the supplier is responsible for ensuring compliance with certain requirements, but do not directly address intellectual property ownership.",

However, I can provide information on clauses related to termination and modification.\n\nClause 6 states that this Contract may not be modified or terminated except in writing, and no claimed modification, termination or waiver shall be binding unless also signed by an authorized representative of Playboy. This implies that there is a requirement for written agreement for any modifications or terminations, but it does not explicitly state the circumstances under which termination can occur.\n\nIf you're looking for information on termination clauses, I can provide general guidance or help with extracting other types of contract provisions.",

This lack of clarity on the specific conditions for termination means that the risk level is low, as it suggests that termination may require more formalities than usual, rather than providing a clear indication of when termination can occur without written agreement.",
